# Think Codables

Conference: [Macoun](https://macoun.de)

## Summary

Since Swift 4 (*released in Sep 2017*), the Swift Standard Library contains the `Codable` protocol. Since then Codables are a first party citizen if you want to convert data into your own classes and/or structs. But you don't have to structure your models as you receive your data from an API. This talk should give you a small overview of how to customize the de- and encoding of your models in a way that you have the control on how you want to structure your code.
